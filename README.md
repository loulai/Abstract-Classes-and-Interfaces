Interfaces vs. Abstract Classes
=======
Both interfaces and abstract classes are required for abstraction.

### Interfaces
An empty shell with only method signatures - there is no code in the method bodies. 
The person writing the interface: *This thing should look like this*
The person using the interface: *Cool, I'll write a thing that looks like that*

### Abstract Classes
