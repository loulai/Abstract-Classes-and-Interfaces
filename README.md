Interfaces vs. Abstract Classes
=======
Both interfaces and abstract classes are required for abstraction.

Interfaces
---
An interface is an empty shell with only method signatures. No code in the method bodies. 

The person writing the interface: *This thing should look like this.*

The person using the interface: *Cool, I'll write a thing that looks like that.*

Abstract Classes
---
An abstract class is very similar to an interface, but with something extra: you can define common behaviour and characteristics. To use an abstract class, you inherit methods that may or may not be already fleshed out.

The person writing the abstract class: *This thing looks like this and I'm defining that they have commanilities, and I've left some blanks for you to flesh out.*

The person using the abstract class: *Cool, I'll write a thing that looks like that.*
